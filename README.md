# Astro-Knots
This project is about a interactive interface for learning about the solar system.

<br/>

**Project Overview**

This project aims to create an engaging and educational 3D visualization of the solar system, showcasing the planets, their moons, and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Utilizing Three.js for rendering and NASA's API for real-time data, the application serves as both an interactive experience and a powerful tool for understanding our celestial neighborhood.

**Key Features**

*3D Planetary Models* - Realistic representations of the solar system's planets, each textured with high-resolution images that reflect their unique characteristics.

*Interactive Controls* - Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the solar system from different angles, enhancing the learning experience through engagement.

*NEO Visualization* - Integration with NASA's NEO API to display real-time information about near-Earth objects, including their trajectories and sizes.

*Educational Resource* - Provides valuable information about planetary positions, sizes, and distances, making it an excellent tool for educational purposes in schools and for space enthusiasts.

<br/>

**Technical Stack**

*Three.js* - A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.

*NASA API* - For accessing data on near-Earth objects and providing dynamic content updates.

*HTML/CSS/JavaScript* - Core web technologies used to build the application interface.

<br/>

**Purpose and Impact**

This project aims to inspire curiosity and promote learning about space and our solar system. By visualizing the NEOs, it raises awareness of their potential impact on Earth, fostering discussions about planetary defense and the importance of space exploration.
