This project is about a interactive interface for learning about the solar system.

**Project Overview**

This project aims to create an engaging and educational 3D visualization of the solar system, showcasing the planets, their moons, and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Utilizing Three.js for rendering and NASA's API for real-time data, the application serves as both an interactive experience and a powerful tool for understanding our celestial neighborhood.
