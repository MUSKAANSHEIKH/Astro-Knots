# Astro-Knots
This project is about a interactive interface for learning about the solar system.

**Project Overview**

This project aims to create an engaging and educational 3D visualization of the solar system, showcasing the planets, their moons, and near-Earth objects (NEOs). Utilizing Three.js for rendering and NASA's API for real-time data, the application serves as both an interactive experience and a powerful tool for understanding our celestial neighborhood.

**Key Features**

*3D Planetary Models* - Realistic representations of the solar system's planets, each textured with high-resolution images that reflect their unique characteristics.

*Interactive Controls* - Users can rotate, zoom, and explore the solar system from different angles, enhancing the learning experience through engagement.
